A simple server that serves to track deployment venues.

## Setup

Before running the server, make sure to set the following environment variable:

```bash
export NUMIA_API_TOKEN=your_api_token_here
```

## Running

In `src`, run `go run .` to start the server.
Run `go run . --debug` to instead query the configured venue once.
